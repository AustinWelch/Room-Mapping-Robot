# Hardware Assembly

### Summary

In our project we had to utilize a jumper wire to avoid a conflict between the motor PWM and the LCD backlight enable. To resolve this the conflicting pin was bent and the jumper wire connected to VCC was put into the LCD header. 

### Materials Used
- 3-Channel Wide FOV Time-of-Flight Distance Sensor for TI-RSLK MAX Using OPT3101
- TI-RSLK Max
- MSP432P401R Micro Controller
