<html><head><title></title></head><body><h1>Overview</h1><br>Image Reformer is a utility that converts images into C code for use with MSP430 Graphics Library. &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br><h4>Why Convert?</h4>Most
images are 24 Bits Per Pixel and over 1000 by 1000 pixels. &nbsp;Most
MCU displays are 1, 2, 4 or 8 bits per pixel and sizes range from 96x96
to QVGA (320x240). &nbsp;So in order to display the image a color and
probably a size conversion is usually needed. &nbsp;Additionally, in
order to save image decode time on a low powered MCU, converting the
image to C code makes sense for faster display.<br><h3>Supported Image Input Formats</h3><table style="width: 100px; height: 112px;" border="2" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"><caption>Image Format</caption><tbody><tr><td>

<h1>Converting An Image</h1><br>From the Image Reformer main
screen press the Open Image Icon or File-&gt;Open. &nbsp;This will
bring up all the available image files in your root directory.
&nbsp;Navigate to the location of the image to load and double click or
select and press "Open". <br><br><img style="width: 783px; height: 587px;" alt="load Image" src="jar:file:ImageReformer.jar!/images/load_image.jpg"><br><h3>Types of Conversion</h3>Select the pixel depth conversion and size of the image to generate based on the display parameters you are using.<br><br><img style="width: 788px; height: 647px;" alt="conversion buttons" src="jar:file:ImageReformer.jar!/images/conversion_buttons.jpg"><br><h3>Compression</h3>Compressed
images will use less memory to display and generally display faster but
will require a bit more processing. &nbsp; Depending on the
requirements compression is available. &nbsp;For 1,2,4 bits per pixel
RLE4 compression is used. &nbsp;For 8 bits per pixel, RLE8 is used.
&nbsp;<br><br>



<h1>Generating Output</h1>The final step in converting an image
is generating the .c file with the image data for inclusion by Graphics
Library. &nbsp; Press the generate button and you will be prompted for
a file to save under. &nbsp;This file is based on the input image name
with a ".c" extension. &nbsp; In general this file should not need any
editing and can be loaded as-is by Graphics Library.<br>
