<body><h1>Generating Output</h1>The final step in converting an image
is generating the .c file with the image data for inclusion by Graphics
Library. &nbsp; Press the generate button and you will be prompted for
a file to save under. &nbsp;This file is based on the input image name
with a ".c" extension. &nbsp; In general this file should not need any
editing and can be loaded as-is by Graphics Library.<br>
