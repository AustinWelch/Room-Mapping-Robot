<html><head><title></title></head><body><h1>Overview</h1><br>Image Reformer is a utility that converts images into C code for use with MSP430 Graphics Library. &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br><h4>Why Convert?</h4>Most
images are 24 Bits Per Pixel and over 1000 by 1000 pixels. &nbsp;Most
MCU displays are 1, 2, 4 or 8 bits per pixel and sizes range from 96x96
to QVGA (320x240). &nbsp;So in order to display the image a color and
probably a size conversion is usually needed. &nbsp;Additionally, in
order to save image decode time on a low powered MCU, converting the
image to C code makes sense for faster display.<br><h3>Supported Image Input Formats</h3><table style="width: 100px; height: 112px;" border="2" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"><caption>Image Format</caption><tbody><tr><td>
